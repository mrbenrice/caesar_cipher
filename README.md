Create a cipher from scratch, which changes the value of characters given by the user, by a factor of a key, also given by the user.

ie.:

User inputs key (eg. 1) -> 
User inputs string (eg "Ben") -> 
Each character in the string changes value by the key given (eg. Cfo) ->
String is returned as the new value.
